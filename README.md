## 📖 About

**Time Runner** is a narrative-driven runner game with immersive historical settings. After accidentally activating your father’s mysterious device, you’re whisked through time portals. Sprint through three iconic arenas—Old Istanbul’s Sultanahmet Hippodrome, Rome’s Colosseum, and the siege of Troy—dodging traps and enemies to survive.
